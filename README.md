## Setup

- SQLite has been used as database
- You can change connection string from *appsettings.json* within *aspnetcore.ntier.API*
- Make sure proper versions of [.NET SDK](https://automapper.org/) and [dotnet-ef](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet) tool are installed
- Run `aspnetcore.ntier.API` project to start the application

## Authentication

- Authentication has been added for version 2 endpoints.
- Non auth endpoints require JWT token to be provided otherwise 401 response will be returned
- So you have to login or register first in order to get the JWT token then add it to the header while sending a request. It can be done by:
  - Clicking lock icon next to the particular endpoint and pasting token in the textbox on swagger page
  - Adding token for the ```Authorization``` header of the request
- You can disable authentication for endpoints by removing ```Authorize``` attribute from the particular controller

## Versioning

- URL versioning has been implemented and currently there are 2 versions.
- Versions can be changed via Swagger page or by providing version number in the URL.

## Logging

- Structured logging using [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) has been implemented.
- Currently logs are being added to file and console. 
- You can change or find the settings in *appsettings.json*.
- In *UserService* there examples of formatting the log message or using different levels of logging
- Logging will be improved over time.
